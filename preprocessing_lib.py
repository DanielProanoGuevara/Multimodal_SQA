ECG and PCG preprocessing library.

@file: preprocessing_lib.py

@coding: utf_8

@description: This module intends to contain all the preprocessing functions
necessary for the digital signal processing of several databases, considering
the ECG and PCG signals. The databases that this code is meant for are:

PCG:
    - Physionet 2016 a-f

@functions:
- resolution_normalization(data, resolution, centered_on_zero): normalizes data
based on the sampling resolution. Takes into consideration if the input data
is already centered at zero, or it needs to be centered.

- z_score_standardization(data): standardizes data based on the z-score. It
makes the data have 0 mean and a standard deviation of 1.

- downsample(input_signal, orig_freq, target_freq): downsamples the input
signal, enforcing that the Shannon-Nyquist criteria is always met by using
polyphase antialias filters. It also manages the interpolation - decimation
opperations needed for meeting the target frequency.
