ECG and PCG preprocessing library.

@file: preprocessing_lib.py

@coding: utf_8

@description: This module intends to contain all the preprocessing functions
necessary for the digital signal processing of several databases, considering
the ECG and PCG signals. The databases that this code is meant for are:

PCG:
    - Physionet 2016 a-f

@functions:
- resolution_normalization(data, resolution, centered_on_zero): normalizes data
based on the sampling resolution. Takes into consideration if the input data
is already centered at zero, or it needs to be centered.

- z_score_standardization(data): standardizes data based on the z-score. It
makes the data have 0 mean and a standard deviation of 1.

- downsample(input_signal, orig_freq, target_freq): downsamples the input
signal, enforcing that the Shannon-Nyquist criteria is always met by using
polyphase antialias filters. It also manages the interpolation - decimation
opperations needed for meeting the target frequency.

- butterworth_filter(data, filter_topology, order, fs, fc): filters the input
signal. The topology must be specified, as well as the order, sampling
frequency, and cutoff frequencies. The signal is forward-backward filtered,
removing the phase shifting, and doubling the order of the filters. It also
uses second order sections to ensure the stability of the filter.

- schmidt_spike_removal(original_signal, fs): This function removes the spikes
in a signal as done by Schmidt et al in the paper:
Schmidt, S. E., Holst-Hansen, C., Graff, C., Toft, E., & Struijk, J. J. (2010).
Segmentation of heart sound recordings by a duration-dependent
hidden Markov model.
Physiological Measurement, 31(4), 513-29.
This function was translated by ChatGPT.

- wavelet_denoise(data, decomposition_level, wavelet_family, risk_estimator,
                  shutdown_bands): This function filters and
denoises the inpud data based on wavelet decomposition. It requires a risk
estimation function to opperate. This function assumes that the input data is
standardized, thus, the noise standard deviation = 1

- val_SURE_threshold(X): computes the threshold for the wavelet denoise
function based on SURE. Function taken from
https://pyyawt.readthedocs.io/_modules/pyyawt/denoising.html#thselect

- universal_threshold(coefficients): computes the threshold for wavelet
denoise, this function allows for the implementation of VisuShrink denoising
approach
https://academic.oup.com/biomet/article-abstract/81/3/425/256924?redirectedFrom=fulltext

- min_max_norm(data): computes the min-max normalization of the input data, the
resulting signal is in the range from 0 to 1.
