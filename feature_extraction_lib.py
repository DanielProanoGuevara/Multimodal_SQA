ECG and PCG feature extraction library.

@file: feature_extraction_lib.py

@coding: utf_8

@description: This module intends to contain all the feature extraction
functions necessary for ECG and PCG signals. Also the training patches
creation.

@functions:
- homomorphic_envelope(data, fs_inicial, fs_final, epsilon=0.01,
                       median_window=51): Extracts the homomorphic envelope
based on the AM modulation, where the envelope in the modulation signal, and
the carrier is to be descarded. The signal s(t) is composed by the modulation
signal e(t) and the carrier by c(t) by: s(t)=e(t)c(t). Its separation is
acheived with the logarithmic law of multiplications.

- c_wavelet_envelope(data, fs_inicial, fs_final, wv_family='morl',
                       interest_frequencies=[50, 200]): Extracts the continuous
wavelet transformation, rendering a scalogram in a specified frequency range,
then these values are averaged. The methodology is inspired in the PSD of
Spinger, 2016.

- d_wavelet_envelope(data, fs_inicial, fs_final, wv_family='rbio3.9', level=3):
Returns the specified level wavelet decimated decomposition, as the envelope.

- def hilbert_envelope(data, fs_inicial, fs_final): Computes the Hilbert
transform, obtains the magnitude of the complex results, defining it as the
envelope.

- create_patches(Features, Labels, Patch_Size, Stride):
Create the input vectors for Supervized training algorithms and the output
validation one.
